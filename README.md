# Toys Team - Toy Inventory

As a budding toy collector I struggle to keep track of purchases, when and where I bought them, what they came with etc...etc. If this sounds like you then my simple Toy inventory tool will help you manage your inventory and keep track of when you bought an item so you can then track the value in the future. 

It was designed with fellow Toy enthusiasts in mind who can benefit from keeping track of what they buy, as we all know sometimes we get carried away.  

This site is targeted towards anyone who is a toy/game enthusiast and wants to keep track of there ever growing collection - It initially started as a way for our facebook group to showcase items for sale and could still grow to this in the future, I want to let the community decide what features are added and how it will evolve.

## Planning Stage

### Target Audiences:

- Anyone who likes playing fun games. 
- All age groups down to at least 5 years old due to simple nature of game (as tested by my 5 year old).
- Followers of the artist who appreciate his work.

### User Stories:

- As a user, I want to play a fun game.
- As a user, I want to be able to check my score.
- As a user, I want to know how fast I was when completing the game.
- As a user, I want to know when I have won the game.

### Site Aims:

- To provide the user with a fun, visually pleasing game to play.
- To make the game interactive and satisfying to play.
- To encourage players to play again by showing scores and times so they can attempt to beat the previous score. 
- To show the user some of the artists artwork.

### How this is achieved:

- A simple memory game was created which is fun to play as the timer and score function offer replayability as it creates a desire to play again. The colours and layout have been thought about to make the site nice to look at. 

- The buttons and cards in the game are clickable and have animations/transitions added so the game feels responsive and satisfying to play.

- Some of the artists artwork has been added to the background so it is inkeeping with their visual style and a link to their website has been added. 


## Wireframes

I created wireframes using Balsamiq to properly plan my project and get a good idea of the layout and how to use the available space. Below are the links to the wireframes which includes layouts for desktop, mobile and tablet versions of the site.

The design has stayed mostly the same as the wireframes throughout this project, simplicity was key for me so apart from visual styling the overall layout from the wireframe was acheived in the final project.

## Color profile

I wanted to create something which was aesthectically pleasing with complimentary colours so I spent time choosing interesting colours and built a nice color palette around it. There is a nice contrast between the blues and the maroon which works well but also seperates the background and game board from the cards and buttons so it is clear to understand where to click to initiate and play the game.

## Features

### Title

-  Encourages the user to 'find' due to the wording and the magnifying glass so it gives a subtle explanation of an otherwise self explanatory game. It also shows the game was designed by the artist.

### Background Images

- I intend to make the game a part of my artists website so wanted some of the art encorporated into the background, I do intend to change the cards so that they have artwork on it in the future but for now the background is where you can find the work.

### Scores

- There is a move counter and a timer to make the game more interesting, giving the user incentive to play again and beat there score.

### The Game

- The game board is front and centre so the user can start playing as soon as the game loads. A 16 sqaure grid creates the pairs game and as the cards are clicked they are animated and turn to reveal an emoji. I want to put my own artwork as the image at some point in the future. 

- Once the game is complete the whole board turns to reveal the score and time it took, and explanation to refresh the browser to play again. There is a link to the artists website.

## The Footer

The footer simply offers a copyright notation and another link to the artists website.

## Features Left to Implement

### Restart button
- I want to add a restart button so that when the game ends the user doesn't have to refresh the browser.

- I wan the imagery on the cards to be my original artwork instead of the emojis.

- I would maybe like to incorporate the entire page into my website as another fun way to showcase some of my art, it may work as a standalone and offer another way to visit the site as it stands but this is something I will consider - The colors would need to be changed to fit the theme of the website though. 

# Testing

I have created a separate document for the testing section with everything covered - [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)

# Deployment

I deployed the page on GitHub pages using the following steps:

1. Within the project's repository, navigate to the Settings tab.
2. In the menu on the left-hand side, select the Pages tab.
3. In the Source section, select Main branch from the drop-down menu then click Save.
4. A message will be displayed to indicate a successful deployment to GitHub pages and provide the live link.

# Credits

Here is a list of people and resources I turned to throughout the project for support, without which I would not have succeeded.

### General

- Code Institute - My design took inspiration from a number of code-along projects that have been taught on the course so far, however I have adapted and created my own code so as not to simply copy and paste the ideas.

- W3Schools has been invaluable in helping me with ideas for code and problem solving issues when they arose. 

### Content

- All content for the site was written by myself.

- The magnifying glass icon and the copyright icon were from Font Awesome [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

- Color palette was generated by coolors.co [coolors.co] (https://coolors.co/)

### Media

As the actual aforementioned artist, I created all of the media used throughout the website myself.

- All illustrations were drawn by me, Ashley Marshall - This includes the background images.
